# Lifecycles methods

Create a web app that satisfies the next acceptance criteria

- Should have a `view` named `Home` where we will storage the `state` of the view
- The initial `state` should be an empty array
- Create a `data.json` file with the info you want to display. Add some filterable field so we can add a filter behavior later
- "Fetch" (fake fetch) `data.json` when the component `Home` mounts
- Create a list-type component to display the data
- Create an item-type component to display each list item
- Add a filter by the field you added before
- After filtering, update the `state` to only display those who match that new value of the `state`
